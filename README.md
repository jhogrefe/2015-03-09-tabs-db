#Tabs + Database#

(Remember to make a brand new repository for this.)

First, build a Sinatra application that does the usual creating/editing/deleting/viewing of a Product resource.

For the "products" table, have fields for "general_info", "technical_specs", and "where_to_buy". These should be text fields that'll contain a sentence or two for each product.

It's not important for this project whether you use a database adapter module from a past project or write your model methods from scratch. Just do what's easiest.

Do build views and forms for the various actions. This is not an API project. It's a standard Sinatra resource application.

Add a few products, so that you can verify the index and view pages work. On the view page for a given product, display the "general info", "technical specs", and "where to buy" information. Organize the HTML like I did for the Tabs mini project above.

Then use JavaScript to actually implement a tabbed interface for the view page. If your HTML is organized the same as mine from above, you should be able to implement this fairly quickly.

Languages you will need to use:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Ruby
SQL
